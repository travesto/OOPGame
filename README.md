# OOPGame
A classic text based game with OOP Principles

Design
========================
The design idea I had was to make the game like a Dilbert/Office Space hybrid. If you’re not familiar with either of those, they’re both about the struggles of being a programmer in the corporate world; you should google it. Here’s a premise in bullet form, because bullet lists are great:
  -Main character: You, the programmer!
  -Environment: Some mega-corp office
  -Tasks
    -Compile code
    -Avoid your manager
    -Help Brenda in accounting with her dumb computer problems
    -Escape to the bathroom to browse the internet on your phone 
    -File TPS reports
    -Attend pointless meetings
  -Interactions/NPCs
    -Greg, the terrible cubicle mate
    -The Copy Machine 
    -Compile Errors
    -Your Boss, Lumberg
  -Objective 
    -Get the program to your boss on time (within x steps/actions)
